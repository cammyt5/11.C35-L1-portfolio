    <h2>Proposition: Since 2000, there has been an effective, large-scale global implementation of renewable energy technologies, enabling a transition away from fossil fuels.</h2>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Omitting hydropower (-1.5)</dt>
				<dd>My most deceptive data manipulation decision was to omit the power output of hydropower, as it has remained stagnant over the past 20 years, drawing attention away from the growth of other renewable energy sources. However, hydropower was still included in the calculation in the title - I decided to omit this information for simplicity. However, it does act to inflate both the titular statistic and the growth rate shown in the visualization.</dd>
				<dt>Annotation (-0.5)</dt>
				<dd>The arrow and annotation are effective at really driving home the visualization’s takeaway message: the runaway growth of renewables in the last two decades. However, the growth factor of “12x” is only accurate for the energy sources shown, and does not hold when you include hydropower or nuclear, two additional forms of emissions-free energy that have remained relatively stagnant in the past 20 years. When coupled with the previous design decision, the inclusion of this statistic could be considered slightly deceptive.</dd>
				<dt>Omitting non-renewable sources (+0.5)</dt>
				<dd>The biggest behind-the-scenes design decision I had to make with this visualization was whether to include non-renewable sources within the data for each year. Ultimately, I decided to exclude them because including them made the growth in renewable energy sources much less perceptible (as can be seen in the second visualization below). I consider this decision to be earnest, as it’s clear (from the title) that the visualization specifically focuses on the growth of renewables.</dd>
				<dt>Title (+2.0)</dt>
				<dd>I consider my title to be an entirely earnest design decision, placing the graph’s focus on renewable energy into the broader energy context. Even though renewables aren’t providing the majority of the world’s energy yet, when combined with the upward trajectory shown by the graph, the bolded statistic in the title acts to persuade the reader that renewables are becoming a more and more dominant share of the world’s energy.</dd>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
					A visualization demonstrating how renewable energy generation has demonstrated limited growth over the last decade and is still outperformed by non-renewable energy sources.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Omitting data from before 2012 (-2.0)</dt>
				<dd>I omitted all data points between 2000-2012 for two reasons: to selectively show an incomplete picture of the recent growth of fossil fuels and to utilize a starting point (2012) that was a particularly strong year for fossil fuels, anchoring fossil fuels visually as a major energy source. Using this slim time period also frames a massive challenge - transitioning global energy systems - within an unfairly short time period. The alternate choice - using the full dataset from 2000-2021 - would have shown how renewables have grown from virtually nothing, which would have worked against the chosen bias of this visualization.</dd>
				<dt>Annotation (-1.0)</dt>
				<dd>The large price tag and small percentage increase of the renewable energy share were my attempts to persuade the reader that investing in renewables has been largely fruitless. Though the price tag of renewables is completely factual, its use is disingenuous because it’s a big, expensive-seeming number without any surrounding economic context. I count on the fact that most readers won’t consider how $2.5 trillion is actually an incredibly small percentage of world GDP over that period (making renewables a worthwhile investment in reality) or how a 10% increase in only a decade is actually a massive shift in deeply-rooted energy systems.</dd>
				<dt>Grouping nuclear with non-renewables (-1.0)</dt>
				<dd>While it’s technically true that nuclear energy is non-renewable, it goes against the spirit of my argument by clumping in this emissions-free source of energy with the fossil fuels that are “actually powering the globe.” Including nuclear with the brown-colored renewable energy sources would have increased the perception of renewables as a substantial source of global energy - which is why I chose to do the opposite.</dd>
				<dt>Use of color (-0.5)</dt>
				<dd>I used a lovely blue color palette to depict non-renewable sources of energy and a dirty brown palette to depict renewable energy sources - opposite of the usual connotations of these sources in an environmental context. The idea was to paint renewables in a wasteful, ineffective light and depict non-renewable energy neutrally. I tried a green color palette for non-renewables, but thought that it was less effective as the “green = good” association could have been too easily regarded as deceptive by the reader.</dd>
				<dt>Citing sources (+1.5)</dt>
				<dd>I clearly cite my sources for the two major statistics in the annotation, which is an earnest attempt to show that the numbers are factual.</dd>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>This was a great exercise in creating ethical visualization messaging, and it opened my eyes to the different ways that datasets can be manipulated to send wildly varying messages. I thought the most straightforward way to warp the reader’s perception of a dataset is through the title and annotation. By providing an easily-digestible conclusion, annotations have the power, for better or worse, to take away the reader’s need to actually parse the data. In both of my visualizations, the annotations especially distract from the data that may be missing by framing the given data as what the reader should focus on (in the first visualization, renewable energy sources, and in the second visualization, data points from only the past decade). I still consider annotations to be an acceptable tool when used responsibly. However, I should strive to avoid doing what I did in my second visualization, where cost was presented as an eye-catching statistic loosely backing up my claim of expensiveness without properly connecting it to the data actually shown or being contextualized by its own data.</p>
	  <p>Choosing what data to include or exclude was the most surprisingly difficult aspect of the design process. I found it difficult to determine which exclusions struck the balance between clarity and deception. In the first visualization, for example, not including the two forms of emissions-free energy (hydro and nuclear) that have stayed stagnant over the last twenty year both had two opposing effects: allowing the reader to focus on the exceptional growth of the other energy sources AND deceiving the reader by not showing the full renewable energy picture. Another similar challenge was effectively categorizing data, a design decision that I now appreciate deserves proper consideration as I create future visualizations. The IMF dataset used “renewable” and “non-renewable” as energy source categories, but this didn’t actually align with my message of differentiating emissions-generating and emissions-free energy sources. By leveraging this subtle mismatch and including the given categories in the visualizations while making a slightly different argument against fossil fuels, I was able to deceive the reader in the second visualization, completely dismissing nuclear energy’s part in the green energy transition. I learned that categories (and colors) should match the chart’s intention and not take advantage of the reader’s pre-existing associations in a predatory way.</p>
	  <p>Before this exercise I considered making these design decisions to be a binary choice between earnestness and deceptiveness; now I see these choices as tradeoffs. I especially learned that, in my career as an ethical and credible communicator, I should carefully recognize and annotate these decisions when they are made. It’s necessary to make design decisions that simplify and choose firm boundaries around undefined categories, but when they have the adverse effect of not showing the reader a complete picture, they should at least be made clear to the reader through footnotes. This comes at the cost of raw persuasiveness (which is why I didn’t add any such clarifications in my visualizations for this assignment), but in the context of my intended career as a public servant, is crucial when it comes to creating arguments that are transparent and can withstand scrutiny. </p>
